# OpenEvolve Codebase Reading Guide

This directory contains narrative documentation exploring the OpenEvolve codebase—an evolutionary coding framework that transforms LLMs into autonomous algorithm discovery agents.

## What is OpenEvolve?

OpenEvolve is an open-source implementation inspired by Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It combines:
- **LLM-guided mutation** (intelligent code generation)
- **MAP-Elites algorithm** (quality-diversity optimization)
- **Island-based evolution** (parallel populations with migration)
- **Cascade evaluation** (efficient multi-stage testing)
- **Artifact feedback loops** (learning from errors)

The result: A system that can autonomously discover optimization algorithms, match mathematical benchmarks, and optimize hardware-specific code.
